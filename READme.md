# In the first "first-TOP-DOM" exercise, I commented out my first solution since I noticed that I am using a lot of redundancy. 
# I used ChatGPT and it gave a nice answer using Object.assign
# I liked it and practiced doing what GPT gave without looking but I still ended up looking since my code didn't run. 
# The mistake was, in the second if statement, I use options.type instead of options.style 
# I realized that I should have indeed used options.style since I am basically checking if this object property exists in the options object
# ChatGPT used shorthand ifs but since I am not yet comfortable with those syntaxes, I used what I am learning in TOP as of now which is the long if with braces.
# I wish I am smart and I will not forget this. I work 9-5 and only occationally follow TOP to hopefully learn web dev basics. 
# If ever I somehow achieve this in the future, I hope I can go back and read this to further motivate myself that although I am dull and slow, that I fill eventually and finally achieve it!
